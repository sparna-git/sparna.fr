# Redirect visitors who request the root domain path (e.g. www.sparna.fr) to the appropriate language version
# Fallback to English version if no matching browser language defined
# Based on language version being at e.g. www.sparna.fr/en/
# This has no effect on any subpaths of the website
# Using a 302 temporary redirect header stops the redirection from being cached in the browser.
