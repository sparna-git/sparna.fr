<h2>Web of data and knowledge graphs : an introduction to kickstart your project</h2>
<h3>Training goals</h3>
<p>The Web of data covers several different issues: content structuring, metadata, Linked Open Data, open data reuse, graph databases and knowledge graphs, etc. This training provides a complete overview of the issues, the main standards, the essential “data repositories” and the types of tools that can be used in the context of a project using these technologies. It also gives the keys to properly tackling a project using Web of data technologies.</p>
<p>At the end of this training course, given by a specialist with 20 years' experience in the field, you'll have the answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the Web of Data ? What issues does it address ?</li>
<li>How to encode information in RDF triplets ? how to produce RDF files ?</li>
<li>What is schema.org ? what is semantic SEO ?</li>
<li>What is an ontology ? how can I reuse existing ontologies ? how can I specify my application profile using SHACL ?</li>
<li>What is a thesaurus, a controlled vocabulary ? how to structure a vocabulary in SKOS ?</li>
<li>How to write SPARQL queries ?</li>
<li>What is Wikidata ? how to query Wikidata in SPARQL ? how to contribute to Wikidata ?</li>
<li>How to deploy your own knowledge graph in a triplestore ?</li>
<li>What are the different ways of publishing structured data on the Web ?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Duration</h3>
<p>3 days. This course can be adapted over 2 days.</p>
<h3>Who is this training for ?</h3>
<p>At the crossroads of the Web, data and documentary issues, this training course is aimed at information science specialists (documentalists, librarians, watchers) as well as technical profiles (developers) or business profiles (project managers, data architects). Depending on the audience, the emphasis is on the documentation side or the technical side.</p>
<p>This training is a gateway to the other more specific training courses available in the catalog.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Knowledge of HTML and XML essential. Modeling skills (UML or other). Knowledge of databases (SQL). Knowledge and understanding of the Internet (clients, servers, HTTP) and search engines.</p>
