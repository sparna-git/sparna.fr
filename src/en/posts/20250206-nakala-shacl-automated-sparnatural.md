The <a href="https://sparnatural.eu/">Sparnatural knowledge graph explorer</a> leverages SHACL specifications to drive a user interface (UI) that allows end users to easily discover the content of an RDF graph. What is the best way to make this UI-oriented SHACL specification ? if a SHACL specification for the knowledge graph structure already exists, can it be used directly ? does it require customization ? or is the Sparnatural SHACL spec completely decoupled from an existing knowledge graph spec ? and what if no SHACL spec exists at all ?

Based on <a href="https://www.nakala.fr/">Nakala</a>, a service offered by Huma-Num (French research infrastructure dedicated to the digital humanities), <a href="https://blog.sparna.fr/2025/02/06/nakala-from-an-rdf-dataset-to-a-query-ui-in-minutes-shacl-automated-generation-and-sparnatural/">here is a usecase of an automated version of Sparnatural</a> Thomas submitted as an example for Veronika Heimsbakk’s SHACL for the Practitioner upcoming book about the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL).

We look forward to reading Veronika’s book, and you ?
