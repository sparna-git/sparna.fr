This week I wrote a [blog post on the different techniques we use to configure the Sparnatural SPARQL query builder](https://blog.sparna.fr/2025/01/21/sparnatural-shacl-configuration-manual-automated-off-the-shelf/).

The configuration is written in SHACL. It can be defined manually in Excel files. Or it can be computed automatically from the analysis of the RDF dataset to be queried. Or we can take off-the-shelf SHACL specifications and complement them with manual annotations.

Sparnatural is an excellent way to showcase a knowledge graph (don't hide your graph behind an AI, show it !).
