<p class="lead">We contributed recently to the "<a href="https://github.com/w3c-cg/awesome-semantic-shapes">awesome semantic shapes</a>" repository.</p>

This is a community-curated list of RDF shape resources, be it validators, generators, documentation generators, shapes-based UI, etc.

Take a look at this resource if you are looking for anything related to RDF data validation.

We contributed with the many features available in [SHACL Play](https://shacl-play.sparna.fr):
 - human-readable display of SHACL validation reports
 - SHACL generation algorithm from an RDF dataset
 - OWL to SHACL conversion rules
 - JSON-LD context generation
 - SHACL in Excel editor
 - SHACL documentation generator

And Sparnatural, with its SHACL-based UI configuration, is listed in there too.
