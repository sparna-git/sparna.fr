<p class="lead">In october 2024 I had the pleasure to speak at the Conference on Legislative Ontologies Sharing across EUropean Parliaments (ClOSEuP).</p>

This was a great opportunity to meet representatives from many EU Member States national parliaments and talk about ontologies. This new conference now launched its [website](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/closeup/en/home), where you can find the recordings of the many presentations given.

This was the opportunity to present 3 great projects - related together - in which I am involved:

- First, the *ELI* and [*ELI-DL*](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eli-european-legislation-identifier/solution/eli-ontology-draft-legislation-eli-dl) ontologies (European Legislation Identifier). ELI allows EU official journals to insert semantic markup in the webpages of their portals to share structured data of legislation at web scale, enabling transparency and interoperability.
- Second, the European Parliament Open Data Portal. And how it is based on a knowledge graph, powered all the way with SHACL specifications that were created and published using SHACL Play.
- Third, the Sparnatural query builder which leverages SHACL specifications to offer an end-user query interface, enabling the exploration of a knowledge graph without a priori knowledge of its model, or of the SPARQL query language. I also learned that the Italian chamber of deputies deployed Sparnatural on their website !

Looking forward to the next CLOSEuP conference !
