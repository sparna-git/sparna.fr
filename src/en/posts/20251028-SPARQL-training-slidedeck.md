<p class="lead">I am teaching SPARQL since 2012.</p>

In 2022, I [decided](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thomasfrancart_sparql-introduction-and-training-130-slides-activity-6922285619989606400-Od80?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAiD3YwBJvGpu4Ak2jXNNvmSX7ws2MZ_uLE) to release under creative commons license a complete SPARQL training slidedeck, in English, of more than 130 slides, including methodological tips and example queries on DBPedia.

You can [get this SPARQL training material](https://fr.slideshare.net/slideshow/sparql-introduction-and-training-130-slides-with-exercices/251619316) from Slideshare. The license is CC-BY-SA 4.0, which means you are free to share and adapt this work, even for commercial purposes, but **you must credit me** as the author, by providing a providing a pointer back to the original version, or to this page.

The only part not covered in the slidedeck are SPARQL update queries.

Take a look at our offer on [knowledge graph training courses](https://www.sparna.fr/en/formations/) if you need help with RDF, OWL, SPARQL, SKOS, SHACL, or this kind of acronyms.
