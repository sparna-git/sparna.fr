<p class="lead">While universities, research centers, and foundations have no difficulty using direct SPARQL queries, the use of Sparnatural is the solution that offers everyone the ability to explore the data</p>

The open data portal of the Italian Chamber of Deputies ([dati.camera.it](http://dati.camera.it/ "http://dati.camera.it/")) offers public data on parliamentary activity in an open and reusable format for citizens, developers, journalists, scholars and public administrations. The published data concern, for instance, the activity of parliamentarians, parliamentary groups and organs of the Chamber, the composition and offices of the government, bills and parliamentary acts in general, sessions and minutes, results of electronic votes, etc. The data are organised according to a semantic model, formally represented by [the ontology of the Chamber of Deputies (OCD)](https://dati.camera.it/en/ontology-chamber-deputies "https://dati.camera.it/en/ontology-chamber-deputies").

The portal offers the ability to export data as linked open data (LOD) collections, in RDF format, organized into thematic datasets ...

... or to query open data directly, exposing [a dedicated SPARQL](https://dati.camera.it/sparql "https://dati.camera.it/sparql") endpoint. All data are provided under [a Creative Commons By license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"). Knowing the OCD ontology, it is then possible to write SPARQL queries and obtain the desired data, to be used for studies and research.

[A Lodlive graph](https://dati.camera.it/lodlive/?http://dati.camera.it/ocd/ "https://dati.camera.it/lodlive/?http://dati.camera.it/ocd/") is also available in the menu, where you can enter the URI of a resource and visualize all of its properties and relationships with other entities.

While universities, research centers, and foundations have no difficulty accessing the open data, via direct SPARQL queries, this is not so true for ordinary citizens. The use of Sparna’s [Sparnatural  query builder](https://sparnatural.eu/ "https://sparnatural.eu/")  is therefore the solution that offers everyone the ability to explore the data, through an intuitive interface that guides the user in composing the desired search path.

[Dati.camera.it's Sparnatural](https://dati.camera.it/sparnatural/) allows SPARQL queries to be constructed, visually and intuitively :

Aiming at querying the knowledge graph in a user-friendly way (i.e. the users don’t need to know SPARQL query language to use the query builder), the tool has been highly appreciated by the users of the dati.camera.it portal.



Here some examples of queries and their results in Sparnatural (click on "Toggle SPARQL query" button to display the SPARQL query itself) :




**The list of deputies who belong to Italy's Green and Left Alliance (Alleanza Verdi e Sinistra)  parliamentary group :**

Another interesting implementation of Sparnatural in the context of parliamentary linked open data (see our latest blog article about [European Parliament Open Data Portal](https://blog.sparna.fr/2025/04/09/european-parliament-open-data-portal-a-shacl-powered-knowledge-graph/)) !
