<p>Mainly involved on data migration for the <a href="https://data.europarl.europa.eu/">European Parliament open data portal</a>, he takes pleasure to learn in a variety of IT environments, drawing on his knowledge and perfecting his application of rules, standards, methodologies and the use of tools such as SHACL, SPARQL, XSLT - among other technologies!</p>
