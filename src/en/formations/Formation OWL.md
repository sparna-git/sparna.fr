### Training goals

Ontologies are an important part of the Web of Data ecosystem, and a prerequisite for achieving good semantic interoperability of data (_"what is understood from the data is what has been published"_). This course aims to:
  - provide an overview of the most common ontologies used on the Web of Data
  - position and understand the main conceptual models for describing heritage data and other sectors
  - understand the RDFS and OWL operators available to describe a domain of knowledge
  - create your own OWL ontology in Protégé

### Duration

1.5 days. This training can be adapted over 1 or 2 days.

### Who is this training for ?

- **Data-oriented documentalists** who need to specify a knowledge domain
- **Engineers and developers** needing to implement a semantic data processing chain involving automatic reasoning
- **Data scientists** needing to migrate data into a knowledge graph

### Prerequisites

Trainees attending this course should:
  - Be familiar with the basic structure of RDF graphs (a reminder will be given at the start of the course)
  - Be comfortable using IT tools (text editors, query editors, database management tools, etc.).


### Program

#### RDF structure reminder

- RDF data model
- Reminder of Turtle syntax

#### Introduction to ontologies

- What is an ontology?
- What's the difference between an OWL ontology, a SKOS controlled vocabulary and a SHACL specification?
- High-level ontologies versus domain ontologies: principles of ontology extension
- "Lightweight" ontologies versus "rigid conceptual models": approaches to ontology formalization

#### Ontology operators

- Basic RDFS operators: subClassOf, subpropertyOf, domain, range
- OWL operators: inverse and transitive properties
- OWL restrictions: cardinalities, domain, range restrictions

#### Ontologies for the Web of Data

- DublinCore: generic documentary metadata
- FOAF: description of people
- SKOS: controlled vocabularies
- ORG: description of organizations
- schema.org: structured data for search engines
- PROV: description of data provenance and history
- DCAT: description of datasets

#### Protégé: an OWL ontology editor

- Exercise using Protégé to understand OWL operators and edit an ontology
- Using a reasoner
- Example ontology using automatic classification: drug interactions
- Implementing automatic reasoning in a triplestore: manipulating GraphDB

#### Conceptual models for heritage data

- History of conceptual models in libraries, museums and archives
- FRBR / LRM: structuring bibliographic records
- CIDOC-CRM: description of heritage objects
- Records In Contexts: structuring archival records
- Use or extend these conceptual models in your project

#### Disseminate your ontology on the web

- Describing your ontology with the right metadata
- Best practices for publishing ontologies
- Tools for documenting and automatically publishing ontologies
