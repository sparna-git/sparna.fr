### Training goals

Specifying the structure of a knowledge graph is at the heart of data-centric projects. This specification, written in SHACL, makes it possible to control data integrity, document the model, generate interfaces, combine ontologies and describe business rules.

The objectives of this training course are to:

- Position the use of SHACL in relation to OWL, in a knowledge graph architecture
- Understand the basic elements of the SHACL vocabulary;
- Learn how to implement SHACL tools:
    - Editing SHACL rules in Excel spreadsheets
    - Data validation with SHACL
    - Generating documentation and diagrams from SHACL
    - Setting up the Sparnatural visual query tool from SHACL
    - Automatic generation of SHACL rules from RDF data analysis
- Learn about SHACL rule types: structural rules vs. business rules
- Know how to encode business rules in SHACL


### Duration

1 day. This course can be adapted to 1.5 days.

### Who is this training for?

- Profiles of **data-oriented documentalists** who need to document the structure of a knowledge graph
- **Engineers** needing to implement a semantic data processing chain (migration, management, publication of RDF data)
- **Data scientists** needing to check the integrity of knowledge graphs.

### Prerequisites

Trainees attending this course should :
  
  - Be familiar with the basic structure of RDF graphs (a reminder will be given at the start of the course)
  - Be familiar with RDF Turtle syntax
  - OWL notions (know what a class and a property are)
  - Notions of SPARQL querying


### Program

#### Review of RDF structure

- RDF data model: triplets, URIs, literals, anonymous nodes
- Reminder of Turtle syntax
- Positioning SHACL in relation to OWL

#### The SHACL model

- SHACL specifications at the heart of a knowledge graph system
- Notion of shapes, with their targets
- Notion of constraints 
- Structure of a validation report
- Closed / open shapes
- Theoretical SHACL exercise
- Application of SHACL at several workflow levels:
  - Shapes for data conversion validation
  - Application profile maps
  - Dataset description maps

#### SHACL editing and data validation

- Tool handling: SHACL Excel input table
  - Converter principles
  - Entering simple Shapes on a customer model
- Tool handling: command-line SHACL validator for generating validation reports
- Tool handling: SHACL support in GraphDB
- Examples of European Parliament specifications documented in SHACL

#### Advanced SHACL

- SHACL advanced:
  - SHACL-AF: SPARQL-based targets
  - Writing business rules based on SPARQL queries
  - Extending SHACL with new constraints
- DASH vocabulary extensions
