### Training goals

A training course entirely dedicated to the SPARQL language. For teams wishing to perfect their knowledge of this language and get the most out of it. Exercises are typically carried out directly on the participants' RDF data, to meet expectations as closely as possible. Wikidata and DBPedia are also included.

### Duration

1.5 days. This training can be adapted over 1 or 2 days.

### Who is this training for ?

- Developers who need to write SPARQL queries to interrogate semantic data.
