### Adapt this training

[Contact us](https://sparna.fr/contact/) to adapt this training to your project. This training can be adapted to a shorter one-day format, and adapted to the repositories already used in the information system.

### How to adapt training courses?

Would you like to develop an adapted training course for your teams? The process is as follows:

During a telephone meeting, we define your needs in terms of :
- content
- duration
- number of people trained

I draw up a detailed training plan, outlining the course content hour by hour.
At the same time, we check that all trainees have mastered the necessary prerequisites by means of a MCQ questionnaire.
If necessary, we adjust the training plan together, and once finalized it is integrated into the training program.
