<h2>SKOS training : thesaurus, controlled vocabularies and alignments</h2>
<h3>Training goals</h3>
<p>Training to become familiar with the structuring of thesauri, taxonomies, controlled vocabularies and authority lists for the Web of Data. Trainees will be able to maintain and publish data from these repositories in SKOS.</p>

<h3>Adapt this training</h3>
<p><a href="https://sparna.fr/contact/">Contact us</a> to adapt this training to your project. This training can be adapted to a shorter one-day format, and adapted to the repositories already used in the information system.</p>
<h3>How to adapt training courses?</h3>
<p>Would you like to develop an adapted training course for your teams? The process is as follows:</p>
<p>During a telephone meeting, we define your needs in terms of :</p>
<ul>
<li>content</li>
<li>duration</li>
<li>number of people trained</li>
</ul>
<p>I draw up a detailed training plan, outlining the course content hour by hour.
At the same time, we check that all trainees have mastered the necessary prerequisites by means of a MCQ questionnaire.
If necessary, we adjust the training plan together, and once finalized it is integrated into the training program.</p>
